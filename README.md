# Just another COG in the machine: all about Cloud Optimized Geotiffs

### [Presentation slides](https://rumski20.github.io/cogs-prez-gislis2023/#0)

_A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud (see https://www.cogeo.org/). Essentially, this allows users to work with only the portion of the file that they need, increasing speed and efficiency. COGs are becoming more prevalent and finding their way into more workflows. Oftentimes, COGs are implemented in place of the old standby of specialized server-side software needed to serve raster data or imagery to clients. This presentation will provide an explanation of what COGs are, how to create them, and some examples of how they can be utilized._
